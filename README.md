# Python Showcase Repository

Welcome to my Python showcase repository! This repository serves as a showcase of some of the exercises I completed while learning Python. 
While it doesn't include all of my Python projects, it features a selection of scripts covering various subjects.

## Contents

The repository includes scripts covering different topics and domains, demonstrating my skills and progress in Python. Each script is 
accompanied by a comment at the beginning, explaining its purpose and, in some cases, why I chose to work on that particular script.

Feel free to explore the scripts and dive into the code!

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my learning journey with Python. Each script represents a specific exercise or problem I 
encountered during my learning process. By sharing these scripts, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of Python concepts and my ability 
to apply them in practical scenarios. While this is not a comprehensive list of all the Python work I have done, I have chosen a selection of scripts that cover different libraries, sectors, and use cases. As I focus on Cybersecurity, you will find that my future Python projects 
primarily revolve around that field.

## Contact

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the scripts or this repository, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter (@harpocrat3s). 
I appreciate any feedback and would be glad to connect with fellow Python and Cybersecurity enthusiasts.

Happy coding!
